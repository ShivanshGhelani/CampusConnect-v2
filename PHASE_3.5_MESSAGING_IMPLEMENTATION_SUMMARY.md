### 3. API Endpoints (`backend/api/v1/admin/messages/__init__.py`)
- **POST `/thread`**: Create new message thread
- **GET `/`**: List threads with comprehensive filtering
- **GET `/thread/{thread_id}`**: Get specific thread with all messages
- **POST `/thread/{thread_id}/reply`**: Send message to existing thread
- **PATCH `/thread/{thread_id}/read`**: Mark messages as read
- **PUT `/thread/{thread_id}`**: Update thread properties
- **DELETE `/thread/{thread_id}`**: Archive/delete thread
