# CampusConnect Registration Flow Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive registration flow that handles all the requested scenarios with proper authentication, user type detection, registration status checking, and form type determination.

## Components Created/Updated

### 1. RegistrationRouter.jsx (NEW)
**Purpose**: Main flow controller that handles all registration logic
**Key Features**:
- ✅ Authentication checking - redirects to login if not authenticated
- ✅ User type validation - currently supports students only
- ✅ Registration status checking - redirects to AlreadyRegistered if already registered
- ✅ Event validation - checks deadlines, capacity, registration availability
- ✅ Route determination - decides between individual/team registration forms

**Flow Logic**:
1. Check authentication → redirect to login if needed
2. Check user type → student vs faculty (faculty support planned)
3. Load event details → validate event exists and is accessible
4. Check registration status → redirect to AlreadyRegistered if already registered
5. Validate registration availability → check deadlines, capacity, status
6. Show appropriate registration form → individual or team based on event type

### 2. AlreadyRegistered.jsx (NEW)
**Purpose**: Displays registration confirmation when user is already registered
**Based on**: `existing_registration.html` template
**Key Features**:
- ✅ Shows registration ID prominently
- ✅ Displays event details and student information
- ✅ Team information display (for team registrations)
- ✅ Payment status (for paid events)
- ✅ Action buttons (manage team, complete payment, dashboard, browse events)
- ✅ Important information and help section

### 3. StudentEventRegistration.jsx (UPDATED)
**Purpose**: Main registration form that handles both individual and team registration
**Based on**: `event_registration.html` template
**Key Features**:
- ✅ Accepts `forceTeamMode` prop for explicit team registration
- ✅ Pre-fills form with user data
- ✅ Dynamic team participant management
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ Removed duplicate registration status checking (handled by router)

### 4. Updated Routing (routes/index.jsx)
**New Routes**:
- `/student/events/:eventId/register` → RegistrationRouter
- `/student/events/:eventId/register-team` → RegistrationRouter (with forceTeamMode)
- `/student/events/:eventId/already-registered` → AlreadyRegistered

### 5. Updated EventDetail.jsx
**Updated `handleRegister` function**:
- ✅ Proper authentication checking with redirect back
- ✅ User type detection (student vs faculty)
- ✅ Event type detection (individual vs team)
- ✅ Routes to new registration system

### 6. Updated API (axios.js)
**Added**:
- `getTeamDetails(eventId)` - For loading team information in AlreadyRegistered

## Registration Flow Decision Tree

```
User clicks "Register" button
    ↓
Is user authenticated?
    ↓ No → Redirect to login with return URL
    ↓ Yes
Is user a student?
    ↓ No → Show error (faculty support planned)
    ↓ Yes
Does event exist and allow student registration?
    ↓ No → Show error with navigation options
    ↓ Yes
Is user already registered?
    ↓ Yes → Show AlreadyRegistered component
    ↓ No
Is registration open and available?
    ↓ No → Show error (deadline passed, capacity full, etc.)
    ↓ Yes
Is it a team event or team route?
    ↓ Yes → Show StudentEventRegistration (team mode)
    ↓ No → Show StudentEventRegistration (individual mode)
```

## Supported Scenarios

### ✅ Authentication Flow
- [x] Not logged in → redirect to login with return URL
- [x] Logged in as student → proceed to registration flow
- [x] Logged in as faculty → show error (support planned)

### ✅ Registration Status Flow
- [x] Not registered → show registration form
- [x] Already registered → show AlreadyRegistered page with details

### ✅ Event Type Flow
- [x] Individual event → show individual registration form
- [x] Team event → show team registration form
- [x] Force team mode via URL → show team registration form

### ✅ Form Pre-filling
- [x] Individual form pre-filled with user data
- [x] Team form pre-filled with team leader (user) data
- [x] Dynamic participant fields for team registration

### ✅ Validation & Error Handling
- [x] Event not found
- [x] Registration deadline passed
- [x] Event capacity full
- [x] Registration not open
- [x] User type not supported

## Usage Examples

### From Event Detail Page
```jsx
// Button click triggers handleRegister()
const handleRegister = () => {
  // Automatically determines flow based on:
  // - Authentication status
  // - User type  
  // - Event type
  // - Registration status
  navigate(`/student/events/${eventId}/register`);
};
```

### Direct Navigation
```jsx
// Individual registration
navigate(`/student/events/${eventId}/register`);

// Force team registration
navigate(`/student/events/${eventId}/register-team`);

// View existing registration
navigate(`/student/events/${eventId}/already-registered`);
```

## File Structure
```
src/pages/client/student/EventRegistration/
├── RegistrationRouter.jsx       # Main flow controller
├── StudentEventRegistration.jsx # Registration form (individual + team)
└── AlreadyRegistered.jsx        # Existing registration display
```

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Faculty registration support
- [ ] Payment integration in registration flow
- [ ] Team management during registration phase
- [ ] Registration modification/cancellation
- [ ] Waitlist functionality for full events
- [ ] Email notifications for registration status

## Testing Scenarios
1. **Not logged in** → click register → redirected to login → redirected back
2. **Logged in, not registered** → click register → show registration form
3. **Logged in, already registered** → click register → show existing registration
4. **Individual event** → shows individual form
5. **Team event** → shows team form with participant management
6. **Registration closed** → shows error with navigation options
7. **Event full** → shows error with navigation options

The implementation provides a comprehensive, user-friendly registration flow that handles all the requested scenarios while maintaining good UX and proper error handling.
