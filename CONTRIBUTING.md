# 🤝 Contributing to CampusConnect

We love your input! We want to make contributing to CampusConnect as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## 🚀 Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## 📋 Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## 🐛 Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/your-username/CampusConnect/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/your-username/CampusConnect/issues/new).

### Great Bug Reports tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## 🎯 Feature Requests
We welcome feature requests! Please:
1. Check if the feature has already been requested
2. Provide a clear description of the feature
3. Explain why this feature would be useful
4. Consider submitting a PR if you're able to implement it
