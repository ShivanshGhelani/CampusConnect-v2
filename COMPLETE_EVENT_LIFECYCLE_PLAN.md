db.student_event_participations.renameCollection("student_registrations");

// Required indexes per event_lifecycle.txt
db.student_registrations.createIndex({"student.enrollment_no": 1});
db.student_registrations.createIndex({"event.event_id": 1});
db.student_registrations.createIndex({"registration.registered_at": -1});
db.student_registrations.createIndex(
  {"student.enrollment_no": 1, "event.event_id": 1}, 
  {unique: true}
);
```

#### New Analytics Collections
```javascript
// Event statistics for organizer dashboard
db.event_statistics.createIndex({"event_id": 1});

// Certificate batch tracking
db.certificate_batches.createIndex({"event_id": 1});
db.certificate_batches.createIndex({"generated_at": -1});

## 📝 Conclusion

This comprehensive plan provides a structured approach to completing the CampusConnect event lifecycle implementation. By following this plan, we will:

1. **Complete the missing 55%** of the event lifecycle
2. **Maintain the excellent dynamic attendance system** that's already working
3. **Follow event_lifecycle.txt specifications** for simplicity and performance
4. **Provide role-based dashboards** for all user types
5. **Automate certificate generation** and event completion
6. **Implement proper data cleanup** to maintain system performance

The plan prioritizes user experience while maintaining system performance and simplicity. Regular monitoring and feedback loops ensure continuous improvement and quick issue resolution.

**Next Steps**: Begin with Week 1 database optimization tasks and proceed systematically through the timeline, validating each component before moving to the next phase.
