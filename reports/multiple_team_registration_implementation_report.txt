CampusConnect - Multiple Team Registration Analysis & Implementation
==============================================================================

USER SCENARIO ANALYSIS:
==============================================================================

EVENT TYPES DISTRIBUTION:
1. Individual Events: Students register individually
2. Team Events with 2 sub-types:
   - multiple_team_registration = false (Standard: 1 team per student per event)
   - multiple_team_registration = true (Enhanced: Multiple team participation)

USER'S SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT:
==============================================================================

ACCOUNTS: A, B, C, D

SCENARIO FOR multiple_team_registration = TRUE:
1. A is team leader of Team 1 (members: B, C, D)
2. A CANNOT be part of any other team (already team leader)
3. B, C, D CANNOT be team leaders of other teams (already members)
4. B, C, D CAN be members of Team 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... (multiple team membership)

CONSTRAINT RULES:
✅ Team Leader Constraints:
   - Can lead only ONE team per event
   - Cannot be member of another team in same event
   - Cannot be individual participant in same event

✅ Team Member Constraints:
   - Cannot be team leader of another team in same event
   - CAN be member of multiple teams in same event
   - Cannot be individual participant in same event

==============================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
==============================================================================

✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:

1. ENHANCED REGISTRATION SERVICE:
   File: enhanced_student_registration_service.py
   
   Features:
   - Event-level configuration support (allow_multiple_team_registrations)
   - Sophisticated conflict checking for team roles
   - Multiple team membership validation
   - Leadership constraint enforcement

2. VALIDATION LOGIC:
   - _check_team_registration_conflicts(): Main validation
   - _check_leader_conflicts(): Team leader specific constraints
   - _check_member_conflicts(): Team member specific constraints
   - get_student_registrations_for_event(): Query multiple registrations

3. ENHANCED TEAM REGISTRATION:
   - Supports both single and multiple team modes
   - Event-driven configuration
   - Comprehensive role tracking
   - Atomic registration operations

4. TESTING FRAMEWORK:
   File: test_multiple_team_registration.py
   
   Test Scenarios:
   - Single team event (standard functionality)
   - Multiple team constraints validation
   - Student in multiple teams as member
   - Leadership conflict prevention

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
==============================================================================

REGISTRATION CONFLICT MATRIX:

Event Type: multiple_team_registration = FALSE
┌─────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Current Role    │ Individual   │ Team Leader  │ Team Member  │
├─────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
│ None           │ ✅ Allowed   │ ✅ Allowed   │ ✅ Allowed   │
│ Individual     │ ❌ Conflict  │ ❌ Conflict  │ ❌ Conflict  │
│ Team Leader    │ ❌ Conflict  │ ❌ Conflict  │ ❌ Conflict  │
│ Team Member    │ ❌ Conflict  │ ❌ Conflict  │ ❌ Conflict  │
└─────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘

Event Type: multiple_team_registration = TRUE
┌─────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Current Role    │ Individual   │ Team Leader  │ Team Member  │
├─────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
│ None           │ ✅ Allowed   │ ✅ Allowed   │ ✅ Allowed   │
│ Individual     │ ❌ Conflict  │ ❌ Conflict  │ ❌ Conflict  │
│ Team Leader    │ ❌ Conflict  │ ❌ Conflict  │ ❌ Conflict  │
│ Team Member    │ ❌ Conflict  │ ❌ Conflict  │ ✅ Allowed   │
└─────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘

KEY DIFFERENCES:
- Standard Mode: One registration per student per event
- Enhanced Mode: Multiple team memberships allowed, single leadership

==============================================================================
DATABASE STRUCTURE ENHANCEMENT
==============================================================================

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT STRUCTURE:
```json
{
  "_id": "REG_22BEIT30043_EVT001_TEAM123_20250812",
  "registration_id": "REG_12345",
  "student": {
    "enrollment_no": "22BEIT30043",
    "name": "Student Name",
    "department": "IT"
  },
  "event": {
    "event_id": "EVT001",
    "event_name": "Technical Workshop",
    "allows_multiple_teams": true
  },
  "registration": {
    "type": "team_member",  // individual, team_leader, team_member
    "status": "active",
    "registered_at": "2025-08-12T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "team": {
    "team_id": "TEAM_EVT001_20250812_ABC1",
    "team_name": "CodeMasters",
    "team_leader": "22BEIT30001",
    "role": "Member",
    "total_members": 4
  }
}
```

QUERY PATTERNS:
- Find all teams for student: {"student.enrollment_no": "22BEIT30043"}
- Find leadership roles: {"registration.type": "team_leader"}
- Find member roles: {"registration.type": "team_member"}
- Event-specific: {"event.event_id": "EVT001"}

==============================================================================
API INTEGRATION
==============================================================================

ENHANCED ENDPOINTS:

1. POST /api/v1/registrations/team
   - Validates against event configuration
   - Enforces multiple team constraints
   - Returns detailed conflict information

2. GET /api/v1/registrations/student/{enrollment}/event/{event_id}
   - Returns all registrations for student in event
   - Shows leadership and member roles
   - Displays team participation summary

3. GET /api/v1/registrations/conflicts/{enrollment}/{event_id}
   - Checks registration conflicts before submission
   - Returns allowed registration types
   - Prevents UI errors

==============================================================================
TESTING SCENARIOS COVERED
==============================================================================

✅ SCENARIO 1: Standard Single Team Event
   - A leads Team 1 (B, C, D as members)
   - Validates existing functionality works

✅ SCENARIO 2: Multiple Team Constraints
   - A leads Team 1, tries to lead Team 2 (should fail)
   - B tries to lead Team 2 while member of Team 1 (should fail)
   - B joins Team 2 as member (should succeed)

✅ SCENARIO 3: Multiple Team Membership
   - Student B joins 3 different teams as member
   - Validates multiple membership functionality
   - Tests registration query capabilities

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE
==============================================================================

EVENT CREATION WITH MULTIPLE TEAM SUPPORT:
```python
event_data = {
    "event_id": "HACKATHON_2025",
    "event_name": "Annual Hackathon",
    "registration_mode": "team",
    "allow_multiple_team_registrations": True,  # KEY SETTING
    "team_size_min": 2,
    "team_size_max": 5,
    "max_participants": 200
}
```

ORGANIZER CONTROL:
- When creating event, organizer sets "allow_multiple_team_registrations"
- TRUE: Enables complex team participation (your requirement)
- FALSE: Standard single team per student

==============================================================================
