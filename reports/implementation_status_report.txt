==============================================================================
🔄 WHAT WE REPLACED AND WHERE
==============================================================================

1. REGISTRATION SYSTEM REPLACEMENT
===================================
OLD COMPLEX SYSTEM:
❌ Multiple services (student_registration_service.py, enhanced_student_registration_service.py)
❌ Complex nested dictionary tracking in events collection
❌ Scattered data across 8+ fields per event
❌ 6+ database operations per registration

NEW UNIFIED SYSTEM:
✅ Single ParticipationService handles everything
✅ One document per student-event relationship
✅ Single database operation per registration
✅ Clean, indexed queries

REPLACEMENT MAPPING:
- EnhancedStudentRegistrationService → StudentEventParticipationService
- Complex event.registrations tracking → student_event_participations collection
- Multiple API endpoints → Unified /api/v1/participations endpoints

2. ATTENDANCE SYSTEM INTEGRATION
=================================
OLD SYSTEM:
❌ dynamic_attendance_service.py used old student_registrations collection
❌ Scattered attendance data in events collection

NEW SYSTEM:
✅ Updated dynamic_attendance_service.py to use student_event_participations
✅ Integrated attendance directly into participation lifecycle
✅ Real-time attendance percentage calculation

CHANGES MADE:
- Line 193: Changed "student_registrations" → "student_event_participations"
- Line 241: Updated query structure for new collection
- Updated analytics to use unified participation data

3. STATISTICS SYSTEM REPLACEMENT
=================================
OLD SYSTEM:
❌ utils/statistics.py used separate collections (registrations, attendance, feedback)
❌ Complex aggregation across multiple collections

NEW SYSTEM:
✅ Updated statistics.py to use unified participation data
✅ Single collection queries for all statistics
✅ Real-time analytics from participation lifecycle

REPLACEMENT:
- Multiple collection queries → Single student_event_participations query
- Complex aggregation → Simple field counting from unified documents

4. API ARCHITECTURE REPLACEMENT
===============================
OLD SCATTERED ENDPOINTS:
❌ Registration endpoints in student_registrations.py
❌ Attendance endpoints in separate files
❌ Feedback/certificate endpoints scattered

NEW UNIFIED ENDPOINTS:
✅ All participation management in /api/v1/participations
✅ RESTful design with clear resource hierarchy
✅ Consistent authentication and validation
