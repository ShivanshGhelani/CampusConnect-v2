## Attendance Strategy Details

### Strategy Implementation Logic

#### 1. SINGLE_MARK Strategy
- **Use Case**: Events ≤ 6 hours, single session focus
- **Implementation**: One attendance checkpoint during event
- **Examples**: Seminars, guest lectures, single matches
- **Criteria**: Present = Attended, Absent = Not attended

#### 2. DAY_BASED Strategy  
- **Use Case**: Multi-day events, training programs
- **Implementation**: Daily attendance tracking
- **Examples**: Workshops, training camps, conferences
- **Criteria**: 80% daily attendance required

#### 3. SESSION_BASED Strategy
- **Use Case**: Events with multiple rounds/sessions
- **Implementation**: Track each session separately
- **Examples**: Competitions, hackathons, tournaments
- **Criteria**: 75% session attendance required

#### 4. MILESTONE_BASED Strategy
- **Use Case**: Events with distinct phases
- **Implementation**: Track key milestones/phases
- **Examples**: Cultural events, exhibitions, project demos
- **Criteria**: All mandatory milestones + 60% optional

#### 5. CONTINUOUS Strategy
- **Use Case**: Long-term programs requiring ongoing engagement
- **Implementation**: Regular check-ins throughout duration
- **Examples**: Internships, mentorship programs, research projects
- **Criteria**: 90% continuous engagement required

## Special Considerations

### Duration-Based Auto-Detection Rules

1. **≤ 6 hours**: Default to SINGLE_MARK unless specific patterns detected
2. **6-24 hours**: Consider SESSION_BASED for competitions, DAY_BASED for workshops
3. **1-7 days**: DAY_BASED for training, SESSION_BASED for tournaments
4. **> 1 week**: CONTINUOUS for internships, DAY_BASED for certifications

### Team vs Individual Events

- **Team Events**: Often favor SESSION_BASED or MILESTONE_BASED tracking
- **Individual Events**: Can use any strategy based on duration and format

### Virtual vs Physical Events

- **Virtual Events**: May require more frequent check-ins (SESSION_BASED)
- **Physical Events**: Can utilize location-based attendance marking

## Recommendations for Enhancement

### 1. Pattern Recognition Improvements
- Add more event type keywords for better detection
- Include venue type analysis (auditorium = seminar, lab = workshop)
- Consider registration mode (team vs individual) in strategy selection

### 2. Dynamic Criteria Adjustment
- Adjust percentage requirements based on event importance
- Consider time of year (exam periods = lower requirements)
- Factor in historical attendance rates for similar events

### 3. Real-time Adaptations
- Monitor live attendance rates and adjust criteria if needed
- Provide alternative attendance methods for unexpected issues
- Allow manual override for special circumstances

### 4. Integration Features
- QR code generation for quick check-ins
- GPS-based attendance for outdoor events
- Integration with college ID card systems
- Mobile app notifications for attendance reminders

This comprehensive framework ensures that the dynamic attendance system can handle diverse real-world scenarios while maintaining flexibility and accuracy in attendance tracking.
