# CampusConnect Attendance Enhancement Branch

## Branch Strategy

### **Feature Branch**: `campusconnect/attendance`
- **Purpose**: Implement enhanced dynamic attendance system
- **Base Branch**: `main` 
- **Target**: Merge back to `main` after completion and validation
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks development + validation

## Development Workflow

2. **Phase 2**: Intelligence Layer (Days 3-6)  
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced Features (Days 7-12)
