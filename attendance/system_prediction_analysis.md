| **Event Type** | "Workshop" → DAY_BASED | "Workshop" + "Advanced" + "Industry" → DAY_BASED |
| **Target Audience** | Ignored | "Industry Professionals" → Stricter criteria |
| **Complexity** | Not analyzed | "Advanced AI" → High complexity (+15% criteria) |
| **Duration** | 3 days → DAY_BASED | 3 days + intensive → DAY_BASED with optimized sessions |
| **Venue** | Ignored | "Training Center" → Professional setting preference |

**Current Prediction:** DAY_BASED (75%)
**Enhanced Prediction:** DAY_BASED (90%) with industry-grade expectations

#### **Example: "Freshman Orientation Week"**
