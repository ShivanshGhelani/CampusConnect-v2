# 🎉 TEAM "VIEW TEAM" BUTTON FIX - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED

**Issue**: Team members clicking the "View Team" button were getting the error:
```
Failed to fetch team details: Team registration not found
```

**Root Cause**: The team-info API endpoint had two issues:
1. It was only looking for `registration_type == 'team'` but should also check for `'team_leader'`
2. In the normalized registration system, team members are stored as separate registrations, not within the team leader's data

---

## 🔧 COMPLETE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Fixed Team Leader Registration Search** ✅
**File**: `backend/api/v1/client/profile/__init__.py`
**Function**: `get_team_info()`

**Before**:
```python
if (reg_data and 
    reg_data.get('registration_type') == 'team' and
    reg_data.get('team_registration_id') == team_id):
```

**After**:
```python
if (reg_data and 
    reg_data.get('registration_type') in ['team', 'team_leader'] and
    reg_data.get('team_registration_id') == team_id):
```

### 2. **Added Support for Normalized Team Member Structure** ✅
**Enhancement**: Added logic to fetch team members from separate registrations

**New Code Added**:
```python
# Also get team members from separate registrations (normalized structure)
separate_team_members = []
for reg_id, reg_data in registrations.items():
    if (reg_data and 
        reg_data.get('registration_type') == 'team_member' and
        reg_data.get('team_registration_id') == team_id):
        separate_team_members.append({
            "reg_id": reg_id,
            "data": reg_data
        })
logger.info(f"Found {len(separate_team_members)} team members as separate registrations")

# Add team members from separate registrations (normalized structure)
for member_reg in separate_team_members:
    reg_data = member_reg["data"]
    student_data = reg_data.get("student_data", {})
    
    member_info = {
        "enrollment_no": student_data.get("enrollment_no", "Unknown"),
        "full_name": student_data.get("full_name", "Unknown"),
        "registration_id": reg_data.get("registration_id", member_reg["reg_id"]),
        "registration_type": "team_member",
        "team_registration_id": team_id,
        "email": student_data.get("email", ""),
        "phone": student_data.get("mobile_no", ""),
        "course": student_data.get("department", ""),
        "semester": student_data.get("semester", ""),
        "attendance": {
            "marked": False,
            "attendance_id": None,
            "attendance_date": None
        },
        "feedback": {
            "submitted": False,
            "feedback_id": None
        },
        "certificate": {
            "earned": False,
            "certificate_id": None
        }
    }
    team_members.append(member_info)
```

## 🚀 HOW IT WORKS NOW

1. **Team member clicks "View Team" button**
2. **Frontend makes API call** to `/api/v1/client/profile/team-info/{event_id}/{team_id}`
3. **Backend searches for team leader** using both `'team'` and `'team_leader'` registration types
4. **Backend finds team registration** and gets team name
5. **Backend collects team members** from two sources:
   - Legacy: From team leader's `team_members` array
   - Normalized: From separate `team_member` registrations
6. **API returns complete team data** with all members
7. **Frontend displays team information** successfully
